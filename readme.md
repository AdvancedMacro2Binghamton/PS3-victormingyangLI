# Problem Set 3: Huggett's model
They key conceptual new element in this problem set is finding general equilibrium. 

In terms of how to solve for equilibrium, two crucial & related steps are involved:
- We need to find the ergodic distribution that results when everyone in the economy follows the policy function, but gets hit by different idiosyncratic shocks.
- We need to find the asset price that clears the market

The problem set + starter code will walk you through these steps.

Dear Prof. Kuhn,

I did the Questions 1, 2 and 3. The code is in PS3.m and the answers are in 
PS3 Written Questions.pdf.
I think to use the function gini() to draw the Lorenz Curve here is not as
appropriate since we have some negative values. To plot using the MATLAB 
original functions is another thing worth trying. For Question 4, it's quite 
similar to what you talked about in class and I will look deeper into that.

Sincerely,
Mingyang
