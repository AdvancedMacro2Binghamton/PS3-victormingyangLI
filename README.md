# Problem Set 3: Huggett's model
They key conceptual new element in this problem set is finding general equilibrium. 

In terms of how to solve for equilibrium, two crucial & related steps are involved:
- We need to find the ergodic distribution that results when everyone in the economy follows the policy function, but gets hit by different idiosyncratic shocks.
- We need to find the asset price that clears the market

The problem set + starter code will walk you through these steps.
